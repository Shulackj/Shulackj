Graudate Projects
  1. Team Airbnb 🏡 is my master's degree Capstone project in which I collaborated with two teammates to gather data from Airbnb on listings in multiple U.S. cities. Initial EDA can be found here [:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-data-explorer). Our goal was to develop a model to assist hosts in pricing their Airbnb properties.[:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-modeling). We identified key features for Airbnb properties in Austin, TX, through advanced feature engineering to create a model tailored to hosts, assisting them in setting optimal pricing strategies.
