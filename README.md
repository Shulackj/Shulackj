- 👋 Hi, I’m Jackie!

I have a  Master's Degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan and hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Environmental Science from Muhlenberg College. I have over 2 years of experience in Python development and I am passionate about leveraging data tools to tackle real-world challenges.

Projects
  1. Training Insights Dashboard :bar_chart: :runner:  is a personal project where I analyzed my workout data over time. By integrating weekly data from the Strava API, I created a dynamic dashboard to visualize my current training progress and provide insights into past training sessions and races.

  2. Team Airbnb 🏡 is my master's degree Capstone project in which I collaborated with two teammates to gather data from Airbnb on listings in multiple U.S. cities. Initial EDA can be found here [:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-data-explorer). Our goal was to develop a model to assist hosts in pricing their Airbnb properties.[:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-modeling). We identified key features for Airbnb properties in Austin, TX, through advanced feature engineering to create a model tailored to hosts, assisting them in setting optimal pricing strategies.
