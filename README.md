- 👋 Hi, I’m Jackie!

I've recently earned my Master's Degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan and hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Environmental Science from Muhlenberg College. I have over 2 years of experience in Python development and I am passionate about leveraging data tools to tackle real-world challenges.

Graudate Projects
  1. Team Airbnb 🏡 is my master's degree Capstone project in which I collaborated with two teammates to analyze four cities in the U.S. [:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-data-explorer) and built a final model based on Austin, TX Airbnb data and develop a price prediction model [:link:](https://github.com/mads-team-airbnb/airbnb-modeling) for Airbnb listings. We identified key features through advanced feature engineering to create a model tailored to hosts, assisting them in setting optimal pricing strategies.
